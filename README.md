Image classification of a shoes using Convolutional Neural Network. Which detects the shoes to
which brand they belong.
Employed essential image preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation, to improve the
image quality for better prediction.
Experimented with pre-trained data to reduce the training time and improve accuracy, the final
model built on custom CNN with accuracy of 79%.
